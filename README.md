# githubTest

## Description
This is a test repository for learning to use GitHub. This is just a text document to practice the functions of Git and GitHub.

## Notes from GitHub Tutorial
- A Git is essentially a way to save and track files of code, or repositories. With git, I can save every version of my code, and go back to previous versions at any time. 
- A repository is a container for projects (files) that is tracked with Git. 
- within a repository, a .git file must be placed at the root to ensure the entire repository is tracked. All contents of the repository will be tracked, including subfolders. If the .git file is placed within a subfolder instead, that subfolder becomes the repo.
- Commits are like save points. At any point, with git, we can revert back to any commit if we change our minds on the code, or if we want to start over from any particular commit.
- There are 3 stages of commit: modified, staged, and committed.
  - Modified: Code or other element of a project has been changed (modified) but not committed. Possibly, the code is not ready to be committed.
  - Staged: Items that are ready to be committed, but are not yet committed. For example, if you are ready to send a section of a project to be committed, but you are still working on other pieces, you can stage that portion of code to be committed until you are ready to commit more items. 
  - Committed: any items that were staged are now committed.
- In basic form, repos only have one "branch" of code called the master branch. There are other branches which can be branched from the main code. A reason for this would be to work on a new feature without altering the master code. The branches can be merged with the master branch once it is ready to be merged.
