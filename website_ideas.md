# Website Ideas

## Dumb/ Silly Website Ideas

1. **Former** - A social media app
"Link your Facebook or Twitter profile and submit your ex's name. We'll link you with their former ex's so you can talk trash and form a bond like no other."

2. **TapPals** - The social media app that's better than hanging out at a bar

"Give us your favorite booze flavor profiles. We'll set you up with a TapPal (like a pen pal) to share your favorite brands and recipes. Coming soon: TapPacks - once a month, we'll send a collection of new things to try with your TapPal!"

3. **Rent-a-Pup** - Like Uber, but with dogs!

"Ever get the crazy need to pet a dog, but don't have the means to take care of one? Rent a Pup is for you! Order a dog for an hour or two to play, cuddle or walk. Want to give your office a morale boost? Rent a Pup is also for you! We do parties!"

## Improve (existing websites, or new websites)

1. **Watch Party** - binge together

"A site to remove the hassle of being recommended a movie or show to by friend, and then forgetting about it later. With Watch Party, you can manage the list of shows or movies you're always hearing about, always wanted to watch, but can never remember what they were. Send recommendations to friends and keep track of who gave you the recommendation. Link your streaming profiles so people who recommend viewing know what you have access to."

- In the simplest set up, a list of movies and shows you have finished, a list of shows and movies that have been recommended to you (and who recommended them so you can credit that person).

More complex set up:
- Link streaming profiles to gain access to what is currently available for you to stream.
- This would be set up similarly to Instagram, where you don't necessarily need to be "friends" with someone to get or send recommendations. If you choose, anyone can send you a recommendation, and vise versa. 

2. **Foodspiration**

- Website that allows you to post your own recipes with photos to share.
- Gain inspiration to improve your cooking skills with tips from other users and professional chefs.
- Improve your food photography with tips from professional photographers.
- When you have a portfolio of your recipes compiled, order a beautiful recipe book with your creations and photos.

3. **Add Element to PCPartPicker.com**

- Add a feature which 'quizzes' you on what you want/need out of a computer. It then recommends components that are compatible with each other for a customized build.
- Asks questions about aesthetics and sizing for a build that would fit the quiz taker perfectly. 
- Working with existing features on the site, then shows you where those parts can be purchased.
