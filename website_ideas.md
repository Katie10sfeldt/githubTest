## Dumb/ Silly Website Ideas

1. **Former** - A social media app
"Link your Facebook or Twitter profile and submit your ex's name. We'll link you with their former ex's so you can talk trash and form a bond like no other."

2. **TapPals** - The social media app that's better than hanging out at a bar

"Give us your favorite booze flavor profiles. We'll set you up with a TapPal (like a pen pal) to share your favorite brands and recipes. Coming soon: TapPacks - once a month, we'll send a collection of new things to try with your TapPal!"

3. **Rent-a-Pup** - Like Uber, but with dogs!

"Ever get the crazy need to pet a dog, but don't have the means to take care of one? Rent a Pup is for you! Order a dog for an hour or two to play, cuddle or walk. Want to give your office a morale boost? Rent a Pup is also for you! We do parties!"
