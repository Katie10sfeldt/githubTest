# Netlify Tutorial Notes

## Continuous Deployment

- With continuous deployment, one the site is launched, with every update, Netlify will launch the new updates once they have successfuly uploaded, preventing a user ever seeing a downed website.
- Netlify maintains the server for the site.
- Neflify works with GitHub to for pushing - you can select which branch is published, but can also use other branches to create "beta" sites that can be tested apart from the main.
- The site can be set up to split users between the main site and a second version of the site on another branch to gain access to analytics.
