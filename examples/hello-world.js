//On an external .js file, this is how the code will look:

alert("Hello, World!");

//If using the external .js file, within the body of the html, you must include:
<script src="hello-world.js"></script>

//On an html file with the JavaScript in the code, it will be within <script></script> brackets:


<body>

  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

  <script>
    alert("Hello, World!");
  </script>

</body>
