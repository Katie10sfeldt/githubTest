# User Stories

Notes based off the article [*New to agile? INVEST in good user stories*](https://agileforall.com/new-to-agile-invest-in-good-user-stories/)

INVEST in good user stories is an acronym:

- **I**ndependent
- **N**egotiable
- **V**aluable
- **E**stimable
- **S**mall
- **T**estable

The above concepts make up a good user story.

## Independent

The story should be independent (order independent) - stories can be worked on in any order.

Allows for true prioritization of each and every story - one story should not rely on another story to be completed.

## Negotiable

Stories are not contracts, not set in stone! The story will only conver the 'essence' of the desired outcome, while the result will be the result of collaborative negotiation.

## Valuable

The `<value>` section of a user story is very important! If a story has no value, it should not be done. The story should have value to the user.

## Estimable

Each story should have an estimated size so it can be properly prioritized.

If a value has a high value but lengthy development time, it mgith not be a high priority item because of how long it will take to develop it.

If a story can't be estimated, it may need to be split, or may need to be researched.

## Small

How small stories are depends on the team working on it, but ideally, stories should only be small chunks of work. From start to 'done' it should only be a few days at most. It makes the story much more achievable.

**NOTE** The simplest thing that works should be what's done - don't go too crazy.

## Testable

The final step: each story needs to be testable to be considered 'done'. Testable means that acceptance criteria can be written immediately.

This pushes QA to the forefront and allows for easy transformation to an acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) process.

## Summary

If user stories are built with INVEST in mind, in encourages good habits, and allows for good planning in building a project.
