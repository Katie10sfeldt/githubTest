# Javascript Tutorial
These are my notes for learning JavaScript

## Day 1 - Intro
I will be learning about how to use javascript to enhace html and css code for web development.
I will be learning javascript syntax, data types (integers, strings, etc.), control flow (loops and conditional statements), and the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Day 2 - What is javascript?
Javascript is a language for web design that is used to **ENHANCE** existing html and css - it should be used _only_ to enhance after the website is already functioning without it
- JavaScript adds behavior and interactivity
- JavaScript is a scripting language, not a programing language, meaning it cannot communitcate directly with database or file system on a computer
- Javascript is a "client side" language, meaning it runs on the users browser.
- JavaScript is not, and has nothing to do with JAVA. It was only named that way because JAVA was popular at the time. It's real name is ECMAScript.

## Day 3 - Writing with JavaScript
When writing with JavaScript, to embed it into an html, it must be placed within `<script></script> tags.
