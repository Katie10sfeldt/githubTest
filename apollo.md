# Apollo Tutorial

Notes based on the Apollo tutorial starting [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/)

## 1. Build a schema

Create the blueprint for the data graph

- Every data graph uses a schema to define the types of data it includes

### Set Up the Apollo Server

- A schema is only useful if the data graph conforms to the schema's structure
- Apollo Server contains a core feature that enforces a schema's structure

1. Install the Apollo Server and other dependencies. Copy the following into the command line. This will install 2 packages: `apollo-server` and `graphql`

```cli
cd start/server && npm install
```

2. Navigate to `src/index.js` to create the server and paste the folliwing into the file:
   1. This will import the `ApolloServer` class from `apollo-server`, along with the schema from `src/schema.js`
   2. It creates a new instance of `ApolloServer` and passes the imported schema via the `typeDefs` property

```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const typeDefs = require('./schema');

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs });
```

### Define your schema's types

The GraphQL schema defines what types of data a client can read and write on the data graph.

The schema's structure should support the actions that the clients will take. For example, in the tutorial project, the app needs to be able to:

- Fetch a list of all upcoming rocket launches
- Fetch a specific launch by its ID
- Log in the user
- Book a launch for a logged-in user
- Cancel a previously booked launch for a logged-in user

1. In `src/schema.js` import `gql` from `apollo-server` and create a variable called `typeDefs` for the schema

```javascript
const { gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  # Your schema will go here
`;

module.exports = typeDefs;
```

- In the above example, the schema will go inside the `gql` function between the backticks <-- This is GraphQL's schema definition language (SDL)

#### Object Types

- Each object type defined should represent an object that an application client might need to interact with.
  - As an example, if the app needs to fetch a list of upcoming rocket launches, we should define a `Launch` type

1. Write something like this as a type:

```sdl
type Launch {
  id: ID!
  site: String
  mission: Mission
  rocket: Rocket
  isBooked: Boolean!
}
```

- When defining types, the object `Launch` has a collection of fields (id, site, mission, etc), and each of those fields has a type of their own.
- A field's type can either be an object type, or scalar type
- Scalar type is a primitive (like `ID`, `String`, `Boolean`, or `Int`) that resolves to a single value
- In addition to the built in salar types, custom scalar types are possible

**Note** an `!` after a declared field's type menas that the field's value cannot be null (shorthand for required field)

In the above example, `Mission` and `Rocket` referr to other object types. We must define them in a similar format:

```sdl
type Mission {
  name: String
  missionPatch(size: PatchSize): String
}

type Rocket {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  type: String
}
```

- Other types can be defined as well, such as an object `User`

```sdl
type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  trips: [Launch]!
}
```

The `[Launch]!` refers to an array of the specified type.

- One more item in our example must be included:

```sdl
enum PatchSize {
  SMALL
  LARGE
}
```

The `missionPatch` field of the `Mission` type takes an argument `size`, which is of the enum type `PatchSize`.

#### The `Query` type

The schema needs to define queries that clients can execute against the data graph to fetch objects.

Define the data graph's supported queries as a special field type called `Query`

```sdl
type Query {
  launches: [Launch]!
  launch(id: ID!): Launch
  me: User
}
```

- Above, we define that users can query for `launches`(returns an array of all upcoming launches), `launch`(returns a single launch that corresponds to the id argument) and `me`(returns details for the user that is logged in)

#### The `Mutation` type

`Queries` only allow clients to fetch data, not modify data. To allow data modification, the schema needs to define `mutations`

```sdl
type Mutation {
  bookTrips(launchIds: [ID]!): TripUpdateResponse!
  cancelTrip(launchId: ID!): TripUpdateResponse!
  login(email: String): String # login token
}
```

- Above, we define that users can `bookTrips`(enables a logged in user to booka trip on one or more launches, specified by an array of launch IDs), `cancelTrip`(enables a logged in user to cancel a previously booked trip), and `login`(enables user to log in by providing an email address)
- Both `bookTrips` and `cancelTrip` return the same object type of `TripUpdateResponse`, which we also must define
**NOTE** a mutation's return type is up to you, but it is highly recommended that special object types are defined specifically for mutation purposes

```sdl
type TripUpdateResponse {
  success: Boolean!
  message: String
  launches: [Launch]
}
```

- The above contains a success status, a corresponding message and an aray of launches that were modified by the mutation.

**NOTE** it's good practice for a mutation to return the modified objects so the requesting client can update its cache and UI without needing to make a followup query

### Run the Server

In the main `index.js` file, add a call to `server.listen()`. Place this code below the defined server constant:

```javascript
server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

**NOTE** verify you are in the correct directory before starting the server

run `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will launch your server on `localhost:4000`

#### Explore your schema

1. Visit `localhost:4000` in the browser to open GraphQL Playground
   1. GraphQL Playground is an IDE that allows you to introspect your schema and test out queries.
   2. Introspection is a feature of GraphQL server that enables you to obtain its schema
   3. Introspection should be disabled for a production GraphQL server. Apollo disables introspection automatically
2. To introspect the server's schema, click the Schema button on the right side of the playground
   1. The schema's queries, mutationsm and object type definitions appear
