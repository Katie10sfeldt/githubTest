# Apollo Tutorial

Notes based on the Apollo tutorial starting [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/)

## 1. Build a schema

Create the blueprint for the data graph

- Every data graph uses a schema to define the types of data it includes

### Set Up the Apollo Server

- A schema is only useful if the data graph conforms to the schema's structure
- Apollo Server contains a core feature that enforces a schema's structure

- Install the Apollo Server and other dependencies. Copy the following into the command line. This will install 2 packages: `apollo-server` and `graphql`

```cli
cd start/server && npm install
```

- Navigate to `src/index.js` to create the server and paste the folliwing into the file:
  - This will import the `ApolloServer` class from `apollo-server`, along with the schema from `src/schema.js`
  - It creates a new instance of `ApolloServer` and passes the imported schema via the `typeDefs` property

```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const typeDefs = require('./schema');

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs });
```

### Define your schema's types

The GraphQL schema defines what types of data a client can read and write on the data graph.

The schema's structure should support the actions that the clients will take. For example, in the tutorial project, the app needs to be able to:

- Fetch a list of all upcoming rocket launches
- Fetch a specific launch by its ID
- Log in the user
- Book a launch for a logged-in user
- Cancel a previously booked launch for a logged-in user

1. In `src/schema.js` import `gql` from `apollo-server` and create a variable called `typeDefs` for the schema

```javascript
const { gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  # Your schema will go here
`;

module.exports = typeDefs;
```

- In the above example, the schema will go inside the `gql` function between the backticks <-- This is GraphQL's schema definition language (SDL)

#### Object Types

- Each object type defined should represent an object that an application client might need to interact with.
  - As an example, if the app needs to fetch a list of upcoming rocket launches, we should define a `Launch` type

1. Write something like this as a type:

```sdl
type Launch {
  id: ID!
  site: String
  mission: Mission
  rocket: Rocket
  isBooked: Boolean!
}
```

- When defining types, the object `Launch` has a collection of fields (id, site, mission, etc), and each of those fields has a type of their own.
- A field's type can either be an object type, or scalar type
- Scalar type is a primitive (like `ID`, `String`, `Boolean`, or `Int`) that resolves to a single value
- In addition to the built in salar types, custom scalar types are possible

**Note** an `!` after a declared field's type menas that the field's value cannot be null (shorthand for required field)

In the above example, `Mission` and `Rocket` referr to other object types. We must define them in a similar format:

```sdl
type Mission {
  name: String
  missionPatch(size: PatchSize): String
}

type Rocket {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  type: String
}
```

- Other types can be defined as well, such as an object `User`

```sdl
type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  trips: [Launch]!
}
```

The `[Launch]!` refers to an array of the specified type.

- One more item in our example must be included:

```sdl
enum PatchSize {
  SMALL
  LARGE
}
```

The `missionPatch` field of the `Mission` type takes an argument `size`, which is of the enum type `PatchSize`.

#### The `Query` type

The schema needs to define queries that clients can execute against the data graph to fetch objects.

Define the data graph's supported queries as a special field type called `Query`

```sdl
type Query {
  launches: [Launch]!
  launch(id: ID!): Launch
  me: User
}
```

- Above, we define that users can query for `launches`(returns an array of all upcoming launches), `launch`(returns a single launch that corresponds to the id argument) and `me`(returns details for the user that is logged in)

#### The `Mutation` type

`Queries` only allow clients to fetch data, not modify data. To allow data modification, the schema needs to define `mutations`

```sdl
type Mutation {
  bookTrips(launchIds: [ID]!): TripUpdateResponse!
  cancelTrip(launchId: ID!): TripUpdateResponse!
  login(email: String): String # login token
}
```

- Above, we define that users can `bookTrips`(enables a logged in user to booka trip on one or more launches, specified by an array of launch IDs), `cancelTrip`(enables a logged in user to cancel a previously booked trip), and `login`(enables user to log in by providing an email address)
- Both `bookTrips` and `cancelTrip` return the same object type of `TripUpdateResponse`, which we also must define
**NOTE** a mutation's return type is up to you, but it is highly recommended that special object types are defined specifically for mutation purposes

```sdl
type TripUpdateResponse {
  success: Boolean!
  message: String
  launches: [Launch]
}
```

- The above contains a success status, a corresponding message and an aray of launches that were modified by the mutation.

**NOTE** it's good practice for a mutation to return the modified objects so the requesting client can update its cache and UI without needing to make a followup query

### Run the Server

In the main `index.js` file, add a call to `server.listen()`. Place this code below the defined server constant:

```javascript
server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

**NOTE** verify you are in the correct directory before starting the server

run `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will launch your server on `localhost:4000`

#### Explore your schema

1. Visit `localhost:4000` in the browser to open GraphQL Playground
   1. GraphQL Playground is an IDE that allows you to introspect your schema and test out queries.
   2. Introspection is a feature of GraphQL server that enables you to obtain its schema
   3. Introspection should be disabled for a production GraphQL server. Apollo disables introspection automatically
2. To introspect the server's schema, click the Schema button on the right side of the playground
   1. The schema's queries, mutationsm and object type definitions appear

## 2. Connect to data sources

A data source is any database, service, or API that holds the data you use to populate your schema's fields.

Apollo provides a `DataSource` class that we can extend to handle interaction logic for a particular type of data source

### Connect a REST API

To connect a REST API:

- Use the `RESTDataSource` class from the `apollo-datasource-rest` package
  - This is an extention of `DataSource` that handles fetching data from a REST API
- `extend` the class to use it and provide the URL of the API you are connecting to

Continuing our example:

```javascript
// src/datasources/launch.js
const { RESTDataSource } = require('apollo-datasource-rest');

class LaunchAPI extends RESTDataSource {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.baseURL = 'https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/';
  }
}

module.exports = LaunchAPI;

```

- In the above, we have provided the base URL for SpaceX API and created a data source called `Launch API`
- The `RESTDataSource` class automatically cahches responses from the resources with no added set up: this is called **partial query caching**

#### Write data-fetching methods

The data source needs methods that allow it to fetch the data that queries will request.

In the example, we will call the method `getAllLaunches`:

```javascript
async getAllLaunches() {
  const response = await this.get('launches');
  return Array.isArray(response)
    ? response.map(launch => this.launchReducer(launch))
    : [];
}
```

**NOTE** `RESTDataSource` provides helper methods that allows us to use HTTP verbs like `GET` and `POST`

- In the above, `this.get('launches')` sends a `GET` request to the API URL and stores the returned data array in `response`
- `this.launchReducer` is used to transform each piece of data into the format our schema expects. If there is no data, it returns an empty array

`launchReducer` method needs to be written: the following approach will decouple the structure of the schema from the structure of the different data sources that will populate its fields

Calling back to the structure of `Launch` our method should look like this:

```javascript
launchReducer(launch) {
  return {
    id: launch.flight_number || 0,
    cursor: `${launch.launch_date_unix}`,
    site: launch.launch_site && launch.launch_site.site_name,
    mission: {
      name: launch.mission_name,
      missionPatchSmall: launch.links.mission_patch_small,
      missionPatchLarge: launch.links.mission_patch,
    },
    rocket: {
      id: launch.rocket.rocket_id,
      name: launch.rocket.rocket_name,
      type: launch.rocket.rocket_type,
    },
  };
}
```

Using this reducer will allow `getAllLaunches` to remain concise as `Launch` may change over time

Next, to define the `getLaunchByID` method - previously, the queries we established will allow a client to search for a particular launch by its ID

```javascript
async getLaunchById({ launchId }) {
  const response = await this.get('launches', { flight_number: launchId });
  return this.launchReducer(response[0]);
}

getLaunchesByIds({ launchIds }) {
  return Promise.all(
    launchIds.map(launchId => this.getLaunchById({ launchId })),
  );
}
```

`getLaunchById` takes a launch's flight number and returns the data for that particular launch
`getLaunchByIds` returns the result of multible calls to `getLaunchById`

### Connect a database

Connecting to an API is usually connecting to a *read only* data source. To have a fully functioning app, we need to have a writable data source, such as SQLite.

Apollo does not have a specific `DataSource` subclass for SQL currently, so we use generic `DataSource` class

#### Building a custom data source

Remember the following important subclasses:

1. `initialize` method - use this method if you want to pass any configuration options to a subclass. For example, `initialize` can be used to access our API's `context`
2. `this.context` - useful for storing and sharing user information
3. **Caching** - the generic `DataSource` class does not provide a built-in cache: we can use cache primitives to build our own caching functionality

The following are some methods used in the tutorial example:

- `findOrCreateUser({ email })` - finds or creates a user with a given `email` in the database
- `bookTrips({ launchIds })` - Takes an object with an array of `launchIds` and books them for the logged in user
- `cancelTrip({ launchID })` - Takes an object with a `launchId` and cancels that launch for the logged in user
- `getLaunchIdsByUser()` - Returns all booked trips for the logged in user
- `isBookedOnLaunch({ launchId })` - Determines whether the logged in user has booked a trip on a particular launch

### Add data sources to Apollo Server

Once your own data sources are built, they need to be added to the Apollo Server.

We need to pass a `dataSources` option to the `ApolloServer` constructor - this is an option that return s an object containing newly instantiated data sources. The `index.js` should look like this:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const typeDefs = require('./schema');
const { createStore } = require('./utils');

const LaunchAPI = require('./datasources/launch');
const UserAPI = require('./datasources/user');

const store = createStore();

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  dataSources: () => ({
    launchAPI: new LaunchAPI(),
    userAPI: new UserAPI({ store })
  })
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
  });
```

- In the above, we import and call the `createStore` function to set up the SQLite database
- The `dataSources` function is added to the `ApolloServer` constructor to connect instances of `LaunchAPI` and `UserAPI` to our graph
- The database is passed to the `UserAPI` constructor

**NOTE** if `this.context` is used in a datasource, it is IMPORTANT to create a *new* instance in the `dataSources` function rather than sharing a single instance. If not, `initialize` might be called during every execution of the code for a particular user, replacing `this.context` with the context of another user

## 3. Write query resolvers

**Resolver** - a function that is responsible for populating the data for a single field in your schema (whenever a client queries for a particular field, the resolver for that particular field fetches the requested data from the appropriate data source)

A resolver will return one of two things:

- Data of the type required by the corresponding schema field (string, integer, object, etc)
- A promise that fulfills with data of the required type

### The resolver function signature

Resolver functions can accept 4 positional arguments

1. `parent` - The return value of the resolver for this field's parent (the resolver for a parent field always executes *before* the resolvers for that field's children)
2. `args` - Contains all GraphQL arguments provided for this field
3. `context` - Shared across all resolvers that execute for a particular operation. Used to share per-operation state, such as authentication, information and access to data sources
4. `info` - **Only in advanced cases** - contains information about the execution state of the operation

In most cases, `context` is used - it allows resolvers to share instances of our data sources

### Define top-level resolvers

Begin by defining resolvers for top-level fields (since the parent field will always execute before that field's children)

`Query` type

In our example, `Query` type defines 3 fields. Define resolvers in their own `.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  Query: {
    launches: (_, __, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.launchAPI.getAllLaunches(),
    launch: (_, { id }, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.launchAPI.getLaunchById({ launchId: id }),
    me: (_, __, { dataSources }) => dataSources.userAPI.findOrCreateUser()
  }
};
```

- Above, we define our resolvers in a map, where the map's keys correspond to our schema's types (`Query`) and fields (`launches`, `launch`, `me`)
- All three resolver functions assign their first positional argument (`parent`) to the variable `_` as a convention to indicate that they don't use its value
- The `launches` and `me` functions assign their second positional argument (`args`) to `_ _` for the same reason
- All 3 resolver functions use the third positional argument (`context`) - They destructure it to access the `dataSources` defined
- None of the resolver functions inlcludes the fourth positional argument (`info`) because they don't use it, and there's no need to include it

**BEST PRACTICE** - keep resolvers short. They rely on the data from our API data sources, so there's no need to make them lengthy

### Add resolvers to Apollo Server

Adding resolvers to Apollo Server is simple. Only 2 lines of code are needed to be added to the `index.js` file. It should look like this:

```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const typeDefs = require('./schema');
const { createStore } = require('./utils');
const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

const LaunchAPI = require('./datasources/launch');
const UserAPI = require('./datasources/user');

const store = createStore();

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  dataSources: () => ({
    launchAPI: new LaunchAPI(),
    userAPI: new UserAPI({ store })
  })
});
```

### Run test queries

To run a test query:

1. Run `npm start` in the command line
2. Open `localhost:4000` in the browser
3. Use the query below in the left field of the GraphQL Playground
4. Click play

```sdl
query GetLaunches {
  launches {
    id
    mission {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

- On the right side of the playground screen, a list of mission ids and names will appear.
- To test a query that takes an argument, use the following query:

```sdl
query GetLaunchById {
  launch(id: 60) {
    id
    rocket {
      id
      type
    }
  }
}
```

- The above will return the data for the launch with the id of 60.

- Instead of hard coding arguments in to the query, we can use variables instead:

```sdl
query GetLaunchById($id: ID!) {
  launch(id: $id) {
    id
    rocket {
      id
      type
    }
  }
}
```

- Then in the query variables section on the bottom of the screen, we can define our variables:

```sdl
{
  "id": 60
}
```

### Define other resolvers

In the test queries above, some were run that haven't had resolvers written for them yet. Without resolvers, Apollo defines a default resolver for any field we don't define a custom resolver for to ensure the tests will still run successfully.

It does so using this logic:

```javascript
if ('the parent argument has a property with the resolvers exact name'){
    if('that propertys value is a function') {
        call the function and return its return value;
    }
    else {
        return propertys value;
    }
}
else {
    return undefined;
}
```

In most cases, the default resolver will do exactly what is needed.

In our example, the `Mission.missionPatch` schema needs a custom resolver. It currently looks like this:

```sdl
type Mission {
  # Other field definitions...
  missionPatch(size: PatchSize): String
}
```

The resolver for this schema should return a different value based on whether the query specifies `LARGE` or `SMALL`

The resolver should look like this:

```javascript
// Query: {
//   ...
// },

Mission: {
  // The default size is 'LARGE' if not provided
  missionPatch: (mission, { size } = { size: 'LARGE' }) => {
    return size === 'SMALL'
      ? mission.missionPatchSmall
      : mission.missionPatchLarge;
  },
},
```

- Above, the resolver obtains a large or small patch from `mission` which is the object returned by the default resolver for the *parent* field in the schema `Launch.mission`
- We can now add resolvers for our other schema, `Launch` and `User`:

```javascript
// Mission: {
//   ...
// },

Launch: {
  isBooked: async (launch, _, { dataSources }) =>
    dataSources.userAPI.isBookedOnLaunch({ launchId: launch.id }),
},
User: {
  trips: async (_, __, { dataSources }) => {
    // get ids of launches by user
    const launchIds = await dataSources.userAPI.getLaunchIdsByUser();
    if (!launchIds.length) return [];
    // look up those launches by their ids
    return (
      dataSources.launchAPI.getLaunchesByIds({
        launchIds,
      }) || []
    );
  },
},
```

**NOTE** - the server does not currently kow the identity of the current user when calling functions like `getLaunchIDsByUser`.

### Paginate results

Pagination ensures that our server sends data in small chunks, rather than returning more data than a client needs, and slowing down the process

*Cursor based pagination* is recommended for numbered pages because it eliminates the possibility of skipping and item or displaying the same item more than once
  
- With this system, a constant pointer or cursor is used to keep track of where to start in the data set when fetching the next set of results

In `schema.js` the code should look like this:

```javascript
type Query {
  launches(
    pageSize: Int
    after: String
  ): LaunchConnection!
  launch(id: ID!): Launch
  me: User
}

type LaunchConnection {
  cursor: String!
  hasMore: Boolean!
  launches: [Launch]!
}
```

- Above, `Query.launches` now takes two parameters(`pageSize`, and `after`) and returns a `LaunchConnection` object
  - `LaunchConnection` includes:
    - A list of `launches` (the actual data requested by the query)
    - A `cursor` that idicates the current position in the data set
    - A `hasMore` boolean that indicates whether the data set contains any more items beyond those included in `launches`

In a file named `utils.js` that is downloaded from the tutorial, `paginateResults` is defined for us to import in to our `resolvers.js`

`resolvers.js` should now look like this:

```javascript
const { paginateResults } = require('./utils');

module.exports = {
  Query: {

    launches: async (_, { pageSize = 20, after }, { dataSources }) => {
      const allLaunches = await dataSources.launchAPI.getAllLaunches();
      // we want these in reverse chronological order
      allLaunches.reverse();
      const launches = paginateResults({
        after,
        pageSize,
        results: allLaunches
      });
      return {
        launches,
        cursor: launches.length ? launches[launches.length - 1].cursor : null,
        // if the cursor at the end of the paginated results is the same as the
        // last item in _all_ results, then there are no more results after this
        hasMore: launches.length
          ? launches[launches.length - 1].cursor !==
            allLaunches[allLaunches.length - 1].cursor
          : false
      };
    },
    launch: (_, { id }, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.launchAPI.getLaunchById({ launchId: id }),
     me: async (_, __, { dataSources }) =>
      dataSources.userAPI.findOrCreateUser(),
  }
};
```

We can now re-test the server. If it hasn't automatically restarted, simply run `npm start` again

Test with:

```sdl
query GetLaunches {
  launches(pageSize: 3) {
    launches {
      id
      mission {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Write mutation resolvers

Mutation resolvers are very similar to resolvers for query operations:

### `login`

Going from the example, we can start with the `login` mutation by writing a resolver for `Mutation.login`.

In the `resolver.js` file, the resolver should look like this:

```javascript
// Query: {
//   ...
// },
Mutation: {
  login: async (_, { email }, { dataSources }) => {
    const user = await dataSources.userAPI.findOrCreateUser({ email });
    if (user) return Buffer.from(email).toString('base64');
  }
},
```

- Above, the resolver takes an `email` and returns a login token for the corresponding user. If the user doesn't exist, one is created.

#### Authenticating logged-in users

**NOTE** in the examples, the method for authenticating users is not secure, but the basic principles are that of token-based authentication, which can be applied to a method that is secure.

`Mutation.login` resolver returns a token that clients can use to authenticate themselves to the server. To add logic to the server:

1. import the `isEmail` function and require it
2. Pass a `context` function to the constructor of ApolloServer that looks like this:

```javascript
const isEmail = require('isemail');

const server = new ApolloServer({

  context: async ({ req }) => {
    // simple auth check on every request
    const auth = req.headers && req.headers.authorization || '';
    const email = Buffer.from(auth, 'base64').toString('ascii');
    if (!isEmail.validate(email)) return { user: null };
    // find a user by their email
    const users = await store.users.findOrCreate({ where: { email } });
    const user = users && users[0] || null;
    return { user: { ...user.dataValues } };
  },
  // Additional constructor options
});
```

- Above, `context` is called once for every GraphQL operation that clients send to the server. The return value becomes the `context` argument that's passed to every resolver that runs as part of the operation.
- This `context` function does 3 things:
  - Obtains the value of the `Authorization` header - if it exists - included in the request
  - Devodes the value of the `Authorization` header
  - If the decoded value resembles an email addressm obtain the user details for that email address from the database and return an object that includes those details in the `user` field

By using the `context` function, our resolvers know to access the details for the particular logged in user and perform those actions specifically for that user

**NOTE** Above is where we would include authentication including passwords to increase security

### `bookTrips` and `cancelTrip`

Adding resolvers for `bookTrips` and `cancelTrip` to the `Mutation` object:

```javascript
//Mutation: {
  
  // login: ...

  bookTrips: async (_, { launchIds }, { dataSources }) => {
    const results = await dataSources.userAPI.bookTrips({ launchIds });
    const launches = await dataSources.launchAPI.getLaunchesByIds({
      launchIds,
    });

    return {
      success: results && results.length === launchIds.length,
      message:
        results.length === launchIds.length
          ? 'trips booked successfully'
          : `the following launches couldn't be booked: ${launchIds.filter(
              id => !results.includes(id),
            )}`,
      launches,
    };
  },
  cancelTrip: async (_, { launchId }, { dataSources }) => {
    const result = await dataSources.userAPI.cancelTrip({ launchId });

    if (!result)
      return {
        success: false,
        message: 'failed to cancel trip',
      };

    const launch = await dataSources.launchAPI.getLaunchById({ launchId });
    return {
      success: true,
      message: 'trip cancelled',
      launches: [launch],
    };
  },
```

- Above, the two resolvers return an object that conforms to the structure of the `TripUpdateResponse` type.
  - This field includes a `success` indicator, a status `message` and an array of `launches` that the mutation will either book or cancel.
  - **NOTE** The `bookTrips` resolver can account for a partial success where some trips are successfully added and some are not, and then returns the launches that were unsuccessful. It returns this within the `message` field

### Run mutations in the GraphQL Playground

To test the mutations start the GraphQL Playground in the browser

#### Obtain a login token

Mutations are structured like queries, except they use the keyword `mutation`. Our first test looks like:

```javascript
mutation LoginUser {
  login(email: "daisy@apollographql.com")
}
```

The playground should respond with a long string, something similar to `ZGFpc3lAYXBvbGxvZ3JhcGhxbC5jb20=`

The long string of characters is the login token which is a Base64 encoded verson of the email address provided.

#### Book trips

Because of the way our app is structured, only authenticated users can book trips. In testing, we can copy the provided login token to authenticate ourselves.

This test should look like this:

```javascript
mutation BookTrips {
  bookTrips(launchIds: [67, 68, 69]) {
    success
    message
    launches {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

and in the HTTP Headers section on the bottom left (using our authentication string):

```json
{
  "authorization": "ZGFpc3lAYXBvbGxvZ3JhcGhxbC5jb20="
}
```

If everything is working, the playground should return a success message, along with the ids of the launches we booked.

## 5. Connect your graph to Apollo Studio

Apollo Studio - a cloud platform that helps with every phase of GraphQL development from prototyping to deploying and monitoring

### Create an Apollo account

Sign up for an account here: [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com/)

### Create your first graph

In Apollo Studio, each graph is a distinct data graph with a corresponding GraphQL schema.

1. From the Studio Homepage, click New Graph.
2. Provide a name for the graph, click Next.
3. Register the schema (see next step)

### Connect your server

Apollo Server and Apollo Studio can communicate with each other to register the schema and push performance metrics. A graph API key is required for this communication

Within the dialog box, we are provided with our `APOLLO_KEY`, which is a unique identifier for the ApolloServer

**NOTE** The API key should only be explicitly written out in the `.env` file, which is included in the `.gitignore` - the key should never be openly accessible to someone who can view our source code.

- Create a `.env` file and paste in the `APOLLO_KEY=[your unique code here]`
- In the `ApolloServer`, add the option:

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  // ...other options...
  engine: {
    reportSchema: true
  }
});
```

- Save, and start the server. It may take a few moments, but the Apollo Studio will connect and you will be able to click on your graph.

### Try out free Studio features

#### The Explorer Tab

Explorer tab provides a comprehensive view into the schema, including all documentation strings.

Used to build queries and execute them on the server

Within the explorer tab, set it up to connect with the server URL (in this case, localhost:4000)

We can create queries and operations within this section to run tests.

#### Schema History

In the History tab, we can identify exactly when a particular type or field was added or removed - especially helpful when trying to debug

#### Operation metrics

Apollo Server will push metrics data to Studio for each operation it executes.

This will include a breakdown of the timing and error info for each field.

Open the Operations tab.

- The tab will show performance data from the last 24 hours of the server's operation traces (in the free version. For a look at the last 90 days, you must have a paid plan).

## SET UP FRONT END

## 6. Set up Apollo Client

Apollo Client:

- Used to create front ends that communicate with the backend.
- Enables use of Graph QL to manage both local and remote data
- View-layer agnostic (usable with React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JS)

### Setup

In this section, we switch directories from the `/server` to the `/client`

When the directories are switched, we need to install the packages listed in the `package.json`. To do this, run either `yarn add` or `npm install`

To link the server and client directories, we need to include the unique API key in both within the `.env` file. Create a new `.env` file within the client directory and paste:

```cli
APOLLO_KEY=UNIQUE_KEY_HERE
```

Open the empty file `apollo.config.js` - This file is used to configure the behavior of the Apollo VSCode extension and the Apollo CLI. The following code should be added to that file:

```js
module.exports = {
  client: {
    name: 'Space Explorer [web]',
    service: 'PASTE_YOUR_GRAPH_NAME_HERE',
  },
};
```

- Above, we would replace the `PASTE_YOUR_GRAPH_NAME_HERE` with the unique name of the graph created in Apollo Studio

### Initialize `ApolloClient`

Within the `index.jsx` file, we get started by including the following:

```jsx
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "http://localhost:4000/",
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```

The `ApolloClient` requires two parameters:

- The `uri` where the server is hosted (in local cases, `localhost:4000`)
- An instance of `InMemoryCache` to use as the client's `cache`

### Make your first query

Before adding React view layers, we want to make sure that queries will work with vanilla JavaScript.

- In the same `index.js` file, add:

```js
client
  .query({
    query: gql`
      query TestQuery {
        launch(id: 56) {
          id
          mission {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    `
  })
  .then(result => console.log(result));
```

- Navigate to the server and start it with `npm start` or `yarn start`
- Navigate back to the client side, and start it with `npm start` or `yarn start`. This should navigate you to `https://localhost:3000` automatically
- Open developer tools in the browser - you can see the information that was requested in the query is stored in a logged `Object`, inside the object's `data` field. This can be cross-referenced with the server on `localhost:4000`
- Delete the `client.query()` call, along with the `gql` (no longer needed, we have verified that the client side is linked to the server)

### Integrate with React

By adding Apollo Client to a React app, we can use Apollo hooks to bind the results of Graph QL directly to the UI

To connect the Apollo Client to React, wrap the app in the `ApolloProvider` component included in the `@apollo/client` package. The component is passed to the `ApolloClient` instance through the `client` prop

We can now begin to render elements and components within the `index.js`:

```jsx
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/client";
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Pages from "./pages";
import injectStyles from "./styles";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "http://localhost:4000/",
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

injectStyles();
ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <Pages />
  </ApolloProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

**NOTE** The `ApolloProvider` component is similar to React's context provider, meaning that it wraps the React app, and places the client on the contet, which allows you to access it from anywhere in the component tree.

## 7. Fetch data with queries

### The `useQuery` hook

The `useQuery` hook is one of the most important building blocks of an Apollo app

- It is a React Hook that fetches a GraphQL query and exposes the results so you can render the UI based on the returned data
- It leverages React's Hooks API to fetch and load data from queries into the UI
  - It exposes `error`, `loading` and `data` properties through a result object that help us populate and render the component

### Fetching a list

To create a component with `useQuery`, we have to import it from `@apollo/client`, then pass the query wrapped with `gql` as the first parameter, them wire the component up to use the `loading`, `data` and `error` properties on the result object to render proper UI in the app.

First, we build the query that fetches a list of launches, then import the components we will need later.

In the example, navigate to `src/pages/launches.jsx`, and add this code:

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from "react";
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

import { LaunchTile, Header, Button, Loading } from "../components";

const GET_LAUNCHES = gql`
  query launchList($after: String) {
    launches(after: $after) {
      cursor
      hasMore
      launches {
        id
        isBooked
        rocket {
          id
          name
        }
        mission {
          name
          missionPatch
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

- Above, we define a query to fetch a list of launches by calling the `launches` query from the schema. `launches` then returns an object type with a list of launches, in addition to the `cursor` of the paginated list and whether or not the list `hasMore` launches. The query needs to be wrapped with the `gql` function to parse it correctly

Next, we pass the query to the `useQuery` component to render the list:

```jsx
const Launches = () => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_LAUNCHES);

  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <p>ERROR</p>;
  if (!data) return <p>Not found</p>;

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Header />
      {data.launches &&
        data.launches.launches &&
        data.launches.launches.map(launch => (
          <LaunchTile key={launch.id} launch={launch} />
        ))}
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export default Launches;
```

- Above, we render the list by passing the `GET_LAUNCHES` query into the `useQuery` hook. Them, depending on the current state of the data, we render either a loading indicator, an error message, or a list of launches.
- In its current state, the query will only fetch the first 20 launches from the list. To fetch the full list, we need to build a pagination feature that displays a `Load More` button to add more items on to the screen.

#### Build a paginated list

To build a paginated list with Apollo, first we have to destructure the `fetchMore` fuction from the `useQuery` result object:

```jsx
const Launches = () => {
  const {
    data,
    loading,
    error,

    fetchMore
  } = useQuery(GET_LAUNCHES);
  // same as above
};
```

Next, we have to connect it to a button that will fetch more items when it is clicked.

- We need to specify an `updateQuery` function on the return object from `fetchMore` that will tell the cache how to update the query with the NEW items
  - The following code should be placed before the `</Fragment>` tag in the `Launches` component:

```jsx
  {data.launches &&
  data.launches.hasMore && (
    <Button
      onClick={() =>

        fetchMore({
          variables: {
            after: data.launches.cursor,
          },

          updateQuery: (prev, { fetchMoreResult, ...rest }) => {
            if (!fetchMoreResult) return prev;
            return {
              ...fetchMoreResult,
              launches: {
                ...fetchMoreResult.launches,
                launches: [
                  ...prev.launches.launches,
                  ...fetchMoreResult.launches.launches,
                ],
              },
            };
          },
        })
      }
    >
      Load More
    </Button>
  )
}
```

- Above, we check to see if we have more launches available in the query. If so, we render a button with a cilck handler that calls the function `fetchMore`. `fetchMore` receives new variables for the list of launches query, which is represented by the cursor
- We define the `updateQuery` to tell Apollo how to update the list of launches in the cache.
  - This is done by taking the previous query result and combining it with the new result

### Fetching a single launch

Next, in the `launch.jsx`, we use this to build the detail page.

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from "react";
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

import { Loading, Header, LaunchDetail } from "../components";
import { ActionButton } from "../containers";

export const GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS = gql`
  query LaunchDetails($launchId: ID!) {
    launch(id: $launchId) {
      id
      site
      isBooked
      rocket {
        id
        name
        type
      }
      mission {
        name
        missionPatch
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

```jsx
const Launch = ({ launchId }) => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS, {
    variables: { launchId }
  });

  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <p>ERROR: {error.message}</p>;
  if (!data) return <p>Not found</p>;

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Header
        image={
          data.launch && data.launch.mission && data.launch.mission.missionPatch
        }
      >
        {data && data.launch && data.launch.mission && data.launch.mission.name}
      </Header>
      <LaunchDetail {...data.launch} />
      <ActionButton {...data.launch} />
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export default Launch;
```

- Above is similar to how we built the `Launches` in basic structure.
- This time, however, we need to pass `launchID` as a variable to the query, which is done by adding the `variables` option to `useQuery`.
- The `launchID` comes through as a prop from the router

#### Using fragments to share code

When we have two GraphQL operations that contain the same fields, we can use a fragment to share fields between the two.

In `launches.jsx`, we can write our first fragment (containing the same fields that are used in `launch.jsx`)

```jsx
export const LAUNCH_TILE_DATA = gql`
  fragment LaunchTile on Launch {
    id
    isBooked
    rocket {
      id
      name
    }
    mission {
      name
      missionPatch
    }
  }
`;
```

- Above, we define the fragment by giving it a name (`LaunchTile`) and defining it in our schema (`Launch`)

**NOTE** Fragments can be named anything, but the type must correspond to a type in our schema

To use the fragment in the query, we import it into the GraphQL document and use the spread operator (`...`) to spread the fields into the query:

```jsx
const GET_LAUNCHES = gql`
  query launchList($after: String) {
    launches(after: $after) {
      cursor
      hasMore
      launches {

        ...LaunchTile
      }
    }
  }
  ${LAUNCH_TILE_DATA}
`;
```

We can then use this in `launch.jsx`, but it needs to be imported first:

```jsx
import { LAUNCH_TILE_DATA } from "./launches";

export const GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS = gql`
  query LaunchDetails($launchId: ID!) {
    launch(id: $launchId) {
      site
      rocket {
        type
      }
      ...LaunchTile
    }
  }
  ${LAUNCH_TILE_DATA}
`;
```

#### Customizing the fetch policy

Sometimes, we may want the Apollo Client to bypass the cache if there is data that needs to constantly be refreshed.

To do this, we have to customize the `useQuery` hook's `fetchPolicy`

In `src/pages/profile.jsx`, write the query:

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from "react";
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

import { Loading, Header, LaunchTile } from "../components";
import { LAUNCH_TILE_DATA } from "./launches";

export const GET_MY_TRIPS = gql`
  query GetMyTrips {
    me {
      id
      email
      trips {
        ...LaunchTile
      }
    }
  }
  ${LAUNCH_TILE_DATA}
`;
```

Next, we render the component with `useQuery` to fetch a logged in user's list of trips.

- By default Apollo Client will fetch data `cache-first` - meaning it will check the cache to see if the result is already there before it goes to the network for a request.
- The list should always reflect only the newest data from the API.

To get the list to reflect the newest data, we set the `fetchPolicy` for the query to `network-only`

```jsx
const Profile = () => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(
    GET_MY_TRIPS,

    { fetchPolicy: "network-only" }
  );
  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <p>ERROR: {error.message}</p>;
  if (data === undefined) return <p>ERROR</p>;

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Header>My Trips</Header>
      {data.me && data.me.trips.length ? (
        data.me.trips.map(launch => (
          <LaunchTile key={launch.id} launch={launch} />
        ))
      ) : (
        <p>You haven't booked any trips</p>
      )}
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

- In the above, once the login feature is built, we can fetch a paginated list, share fragments and customize the fetch policy.

## 8. Update data with mutations

Using Apollo Client, we can update data from a graph API as simply as calling a function. Apollo Client cache is smart enough to automatically update in most cases.

### What is the `useMutation` hook?

`useMutation` hook is a building block for an Apollo app. It works with Hooks API to provide a function to execute GraphQL mutation. It also tracks the states (error, loading and complete) of the mutation.

Updating data with `useMutation` is similar to fetching data with `useQuery` with minor differences:

- The first value in the `useMutation` result tuple is a mutate function (instead of `___` - it actually triggers the mutation when it is called
- The second value in the tuple is a result object that contains loading and error state and the return value from the mutation.

### Update data with `useMutation`

First, we define the GraphQL mutation

In the `login.jsx` file, we write:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {
  gql,
  ApolloClient,
  useApolloClient,
  useMutation
} from "@apollo/client";

import { LoginForm, Loading } from "../components";

export const LOGIN_USER = gql`
  mutation login($email: String!) {
    login(email: $email)
  }
`;
```

- As before, we use the `gql` function to wrap the GraphQL mutation so it can be parsed correctly.

Now we bind the mutation to the component by passing it to the `useMutation` hook:

```jsx
export default function Login() {
  const [login, { data }] = useMutation(LOGIN_USER);
  return <LoginForm login={login} />;
}
```

- Above the `useMutation` hook returns a mutate function called `login` 
- The hook also returns the data object that we destructure from the tuple
- We pass the login function to the `LoginForm` component

If we want to make it so that the login persists between sessions for the best UX, we have to save the login token to `localStorage` using the `onCompleted` handler of `useMutation`

#### Expose Apollo Client with `useApolloClient`

Apollo Client makes sure that the `ApolloClient` is available through React's context.

In some cases, we need to access the `ApolloClient` directly to call a method that isn't included with the `@apollo/client` helper. `useApolloClient` hook can allow us to access the client.

- Call `useApolloClient` to get the currently configured client instance.
- Pass an `onCompleted` callback to `useMutation` that is called when the mutation is done with its return value
  - Here, we also call `client.wrriteData` to write local data to the Apollo cache showing the user is logged in. (This is a direct write)
- Save the login token to `localStorage`

```jsx
export default function Login() {

  const client = useApolloClient();
  const [login, { loading, error }] = useMutation(LOGIN_USER, {
    onCompleted({ login }) {

      localStorage.setItem("token", login);
      client.writeData({ data: { isLoggedIn: true } });
    }
  });
  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <p>An error occurred</p>;


  return <LoginForm login={login} />;
}
```

#### Attach authorization headers to the request

To finish the login feature, attach our token to the GraphQL request headers so the server can authorize the user.

In `index.jsx`, write:

```jsx
const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache,
  link: new HttpLink({
    headers: { authorization: localStorage.getItem('token') },
    uri: "http://localhost:4000/graphql",
  }),
});

cache.writeData({
  data: {
    isLoggedIn: !!localStorage.getItem('token'),
    cartItems: [],
  },
});
```

- Above, we specify the `headers` option on `HttpLink` which allows us to read the token from `localStorage` and attach it to the request's headers each time a GraphQL operation is made.

## 9. Manage Local State

Managing local data with Apollo Client is similar to managing remote data

- In future projects, local state should be managed in the Apollo cache instead of another management library like Redux (better functionality)

#### Write a local schema

The first step on the client side is writing the local schema.

In `resolvers.jsx` write:

```jsx
import { gql } from "@apollo/client";

export const typeDefs = gql`
  extend type Query {
    isLoggedIn: Boolean!
    cartItems: [ID!]!
  }

  extend type Launch {
    isInCart: Boolean!
  }

  extend type Mutation {
    addOrRemoveFromCart(id: ID!): [ID!]!
  }
`;

export const resolvers = {};
```

When building a client schema, extend the types of our server schema and wrap it with the `gqp` function.

- Using the extend keyword allows the combination of both schemas inside developer tooling like Apollo VSCode

We are able to add local fields to server data like `isInCart` local field to the `Launch` type we get back from the graph API by extending types.

### Initialize the store

To make sure that we don't run in to errors, when initializing the sore, we should start the Apollo cache with a default state so the queries don't error out when they execute.

- Queries execute as soon as the component mounts
- We will need to write initial data to the cache for both `isLoggedIn` and `cartItems`

In `index.jsx` we already added a `cache.writeData` call to prep the cache. In the same file, import `typeDefs` and `resolvers`:

```jsx
import { resolvers, typeDefs } from "./resolvers";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache,
  link: new HttpLink({
    uri: "http://localhost:4000/graphql",
    headers: {
      authorization: localStorage.getItem("token")
    }
  }),

  typeDefs,
  resolvers
});

cache.writeData({
  data: {
    isLoggedIn: !!localStorage.getItem("token"),
    cartItems: []
  }
});
```

### Query local data

Querying local data is siilar to querying remote data from graph API.

- The main difference is that a `@client` directive is added to a local field to tell Apollo Client to pull from the cache.

In `index.jsx`:

```jsx
import { gql, ApolloProvider, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

import Pages from "./pages";
import Login from "./pages/login";
import injectStyles from "./styles";

const IS_LOGGED_IN = gql`

  query IsUserLoggedIn {
    isLoggedIn @client
  }
`
;
function IsLoggedIn() {
  const { data } = useQuery(IS_LOGGED_IN);

  return data.isLoggedIn ? <Pages /> : <Login />;
}

injectStyles();
ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <IsLoggedIn />
  </ApolloProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

- Above, we create the `IsUserLoggedIn` local query by adding the `@client` directive to the `isLoggedIn` field
- We render a component with `useQuery`, pass the local query in,, and based on the response, render either a login screen or the homepage depending if the user is logged in.
  - Since cache reads ahappen at the same time, we don't have to account for the loading state

In `cart.jsx`:

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from "react";
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

import { Header, Loading } from "../components";
import { CartItem, BookTrips } from "../containers";

export const GET_CART_ITEMS = gql`
  query GetCartItems {
    cartItems @client
  }
`;
```

Then: 

```jsx
const Cart = () => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_CART_ITEMS);

  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <p>ERROR: {error.message}</p>;

  return (
    <Fragment>
      <Header>My Cart</Header>
      {!data || (!!data && data.cartItems.length === 0) ? (
        <p data-testid="empty-message">No items in your cart</p>
      ) : (
        <Fragment>
          {!!data &&
            data.cartItems.map(launchId => (
              <CartItem key={launchId} launchId={launchId} />
            ))}

          <BookTrips cartItems={!!data ? data.cartItems : []} />
        </Fragment>
      )}
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export default Cart;
```

- Above, we call `useQuery` and bind it to the `GetCartItems`

**NOTE** Local queries can be mixed with remote queries in a single GraphQL document

#### Adding virtual fields to server data

With Apollo Client, we can add virtual fields to data received from the graph API.

- These fields only exist on the client and are useful for decorating server data with local state.

To add virtual field:

- Extend the type of data you're adding the field to in the client schema:

  - `resolvers.jsx`
  
```jsx
import { gql } from "@apollo/client";

export const schema = gql`
  extend type Launch {
    isInCart: Boolean!
  }
`;
```

- Specify a client resolver on the `Launch` type to tell Apollo Client how to resolver the virtual field:

```jsx
// previous imports
import { GET_CART_ITEMS } from "./pages/cart";

// type defs and other previous variable declarations

export const resolvers = {

  Launch: {
    isInCart: (launch, _, { cache }) => {
      const queryResult = cache.readQuery({
        query: GET_CART_ITEMS
      });

      if (queryResult) {
        return queryResult.cartItems.includes(launch.id);
      }
      return false;
    }
  }
};
```

**NOTE** The resolver API on the client is the same as the resolver API on the server

TO query the virtual field on the launch detail page, we add the virtual field to a query and specify the `@client` directive:

```jsx
export const GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS = gql`
  query LaunchDetails($launchId: ID!) {
    launch(id: $launchId) {

      isInCart @client
      site
      rocket {
        type
      }
      ...LaunchTile
    }
  }
  ${LAUNCH_TILE_DATA}
`;
```

### Update local data

Apollo Client allows us to update local data in the cache with either direct cache writes or client resolvers

- Direct writes are typically used to write sample booleans or strings to the cache
- Client resolvers are far more complicated writes such as adding or removing data from a list

#### Direct cache writes

We perform a direct write by calling `client.writeData()` and passing in an object with a data property that corresponds to the data we want to write to the cache. 

In `logout-button.jsx`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import styled from "react-emotion";
import { useApolloClient } from "@apollo/client";

import { menuItemClassName } from "../components/menu-item";
import { ReactComponent as ExitIcon } from "../assets/icons/exit.svg";

export default function LogoutButton() {
  const client = useApolloClient();
  return (
    <StyledButton
      onClick={() => {
        client.writeData({ data: { isLoggedIn: false } });
        localStorage.clear();
      }}
    >
      <ExitIcon />
      Logout
    </StyledButton>
  );
}

const StyledButton = styled("button")(menuItemClassName, {
  background: "none",
  border: "none",
  padding: 0
});
```

- Above, when the button is clicked, we perform a direct cache write by calling `client.writeData` and passing in data object that sets the `isLoggedIn` boolean to false.

In `book-trips.jsx`:

```jsx
import React from 'react'; // preserve-line
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client'; // preserve-line

import Button from '../components/button'; // preserve-line
import { GET_LAUNCH } from './cart-item'; // preserve-line
import * as GetCartItemsTypes from '../pages/__generated__/GetCartItems';
import * as BookTripsTypes from './__generated__/BookTrips';

export const BOOK_TRIPS = gql`
  mutation BookTrips($launchIds: [ID]!) {
    bookTrips(launchIds: $launchIds) {
      success
      message
      launches {
        id
        isBooked
      }
    }
  }
`;

interface BookTripsProps extends GetCartItemsTypes.GetCartItems {}

const BookTrips: React.FC<BookTripsProps> = ({ cartItems }) => {
  const [
    bookTrips, { data }
  ] = useMutation<
    BookTripsTypes.BookTrips,
    BookTripsTypes.BookTripsVariables
  > (
    BOOK_TRIPS,
    {
      variables: { launchIds: cartItems },
      refetchQueries: cartItems.map(launchId => ({
        query: GET_LAUNCH,
        variables: { launchId },
      })),

      update(cache) {
        cache.writeData({ data: { cartItems: [] } });
      }
    }
  );

  return data && data.bookTrips && !data.bookTrips.success
    ? <p data-testid="message">{data.bookTrips.message}</p>
    : (
      <Button
        onClick={() => bookTrips()}
        data-testid="book-button">
        Book All
      </Button>
    );
}

export default BookTrips;
```

- Above, we performed a direct write within the update function of the `useMutation` hook. The `update` function lets us manually update the cache after a mutation occurs without refetching data.
- We directly called `cache.writeData` to reset the state of the `cartItems` after the `BookTrips` mutation is sent to the server.

#### Local resolvers

Local resolvers are useful if we want to perform a more complicated local update like adding or removing items from a list.

They have the same function signature as remote resolvers (`(parent, args, context, info) => data`).
The only difference is that the Apollo cache is already added to the context . 

Within `resolvers.jsx`, we write the local resolver for `addOrRemoveFromCart` mutation. Under the `Launch` resolver:

```jsx
export const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    addOrRemoveFromCart: (_, { id }, { cache }) => {
      const queryResult = cache.readQuery({
        query: GET_CART_ITEMS
      });

      if (queryResult) {
        const { cartItems } = queryResult;
        const data = {
          cartItems: cartItems.includes(id)
            ? cartItems.filter(i => i !== id)
            : [...cartItems, id]
        };

        cache.writeQuery({ query: GET_CART_ITEMS, data });
        return data.cartItems;
      }
      return [];
    }
  }
};
```

- Above, we destructure the Apollo `cache` from the context to read the query that fetches cart items.
- When we receive the cart data, we either remove or add the cart item's `id` passed into the mutation to the list.
- We return the updated list from the mutation.

To call `addOrRemoveFromCart` mutation in a component (within `action-button.jsx`):

```jsx
import { gql } from "@apollo/client";

const TOGGLE_CART = gql`
  mutation addOrRemoveFromCart($launchId: ID!) {
    addOrRemoveFromCart(id: $launchId) @client
  }
`;
```

Like in other cases, the only thing that we need to add to the mutation is the `@client` directive to tell Apollo to resolve the mutation from the cache instead of the remote server.

We can now build out the rest of the `ActionButton` component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { gql, useMutation } from "@apollo/client";

import { GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS } from "../pages/launch";
import Button from "../components/button";

export const TOGGLE_CART = gql`
  mutation addOrRemoveFromCart($launchId: ID!) {
    addOrRemoveFromCart(id: $launchId) @client
  }
`;

export const CANCEL_TRIP = gql`
  mutation cancel($launchId: ID!) {
    cancelTrip(launchId: $launchId) {
      success
      message
      launches {
        id
        isBooked
      }
    }
  }
`;

const ActionButton = ({ isBooked, id, isInCart }) => {
  const [mutate, { loading, error }] = useMutation(
    isBooked ? CANCEL_TRIP : TOGGLE_CART,
    {
      variables: { launchId: id },
      refetchQueries: [
        {
          query: GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS,
          variables: { launchId: id }
        }
      ]
    }
  );

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>An error occurred</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => mutate()} data-testid={"action-button"}>
        {isBooked
          ? "Cancel This Trip"
          : isInCart
          ? "Remove from Cart"
          : "Add to Cart"}
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ActionButton;
```

- Above, we use the `isBooked` prop passed into the component to determine which mutation we should fire.
- We can pass in the local mutations to the same `useMutation` hook, like in remote mutations.
